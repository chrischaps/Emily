## EML-01: Mechanics of Burden

**Emotional Experiences:**  
- Exhaustion  
- Duty  
- Oppression  
- Drudgery  

**Core Pattern:**  
Systems introduce friction (slowness, repetition, degradation) that grows with continued effort.

**Variants:**  
- Light burden: slight delays  
- Chronic burden: long-term mechanical decay  
- Acute burden: overload of tasks  

**Player Response:**  
Empathy through temporal embodiment of monotony.

**Implementation Notes:**  
- Increasing cooldowns  
- Movement slowing with load  
- Tasks resetting on interruption  

**Pitfalls:**  
Avoid actual frustration unless thematically purposeful.

## EML-02: Mechanics of Disorientation

**Emotional Experiences:**  
- Confusion  
- Cognitive fog  
- Anxiety  
- Distrust of perception  

**Core Pattern:**  
Mismatch between expected input/output: shifting controls, camera drift, inconsistent feedback.

**Variants:**  
- Visual disorientation  
- Temporal delay  
- Logical contradiction  

**Player Response:**  
Vigilance, uncertainty, destabilization.

**Implementation Notes:**  
- Subtle remapping of controls  
- Camera/view drift  
- Inconsistent or missing UI cues

## EML-03: Mechanics of Care

**Emotional Experiences:**  
- Tenderness  
- Responsibility  
- Patience  

**Core Pattern:**  
Systems respond to *quality* of intention (gentle input, steady presence) more than quantity.

**Variants:**  
- Precision care  
- Timing care  
- Non-action as care  

**Player Response:**  
Nurture, protectiveness, warmth.

**Implementation Notes:**  
- AI responding to gentle vs aggressive input  
- Growth through consistency, not speed

## EML-04: Mechanics of Absence (Grief)

**Emotional Experiences:**  
- Loss  
- Emptiness  
- Mourning  
- Change  

**Core Pattern:**  
Removing a previously reliable mechanic, companion, or environmental affordance.

**Variants:**  
- Ability removal  
- Environmental decay  
- Ghost-like echoes  

**Player Response:**  
Reflection, longing, quiet emotional impact.

**Implementation Notes:**  
- Empty UI slots  
- Audio/visual reduction  
- Leaving “ghost affordances” where mechanics used to be

## EML-05: Mechanics of Intimacy

**Emotional Experiences:**  
- Closeness  
- Trust  
- Vulnerability  

**Core Pattern:**  
New interactions unlock through slow, attentive presence or sync with another agent.

**Variants:**  
- Co-motion  
- Vulnerability-based unlocks  
- Escalating emotional responsiveness  

**Player Response:**  
Connection, attunement, emotional warmth.

**Implementation Notes:**  
- Rhythm-based sync  
- AI emotional states

## EML-06: Mechanics of Temptation

**Emotional Experiences:**  
- Impulse  
- Curiosity  
- Internal conflict  

**Core Pattern:**  
Short-term reward contrasted with subtle long-term cost.

**Variants:**  
- Forbidden button  
- Corrupting shortcuts  
- Breaking self-imposed rules  

**Player Response:**  
Playful tension, guilt, curiosity.

**Implementation Notes:**  
- Environmental corruption over time  
- Gradual feedback escalation  

---

## EML-07: Mechanics of Ambivalence

**Emotional Experiences:**  
- Moral uncertainty  
- Conflicted desire  
- Mixed emotions  

**Core Pattern:**  
All choices simultaneously help and harm in real, meaningful ways.

**Variants:**  
- Dual-meter systems  
- Factional tension  
- Emotional-stat conflicts  

**Player Response:**  
Slow thinking, introspection, complexity.

**Pitfalls:**  
Avoid trivial “correct” choices—ambivalence must be authentic.
